Benchmark: π-approximation from a 2D Sobol-sequence
===================================================

This benchmarks uses a two-dimensional Sobol-sequences to approximate
the value of π.

Implementations are expected to use the inductive algorithm for
computing Sobol-numbers. Two direction vectors are given.

Results does not need to exactly match the reference implementation,
to allow usage of non-deterministic parallel reduction for summation.
