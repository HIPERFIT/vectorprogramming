\chapter{Motivation}
% What is the over all subject matter and why is it interesting to do
% further research in this subject

Banks have a lot of money, and thus large computers and large graphics
cards. For a long time they haven't been able to figure out how to use
all these resources...

\todo{explain pricing algorithms, high performance computing in the
  financial sector, etc.}

The improvements in parallel vector languages and tools for general
purpose GPU programming will not be restricted to the financial
sector, as high performance computing has a wide audience in the
scientific community, the methods are useful in for example weather
forecasting, bioinformatics and simulation of chemical
reactions\todo{name other applications}.


\chapter{Project goals}
% In short describe the experiment we are going to make
In this project we will first seek to find the extend to which
current parallel vector languages are applicable for the financial
domain, by implementing a set of predetermined pricing algorithms in
existing languages.

We will then determine how we can improve the state-of-the-art of
vector languages in the context of pricing algorithms. We will do so
in terms of expressiveness, safety and efficiency, by implementing
enhancements for one or more of the existing languages.

\chapter{Elaboration}
% Elaborate on the experiment, e.g. how it should be conducted and
% what others have done previously

\todo{mention GPU programming and highly parallel computer architecture}

As the first task in our project, we will conduct a survey among
existing vector languages, such as
Accelerate\cite{chakravarty2011accelerating}, Nikola
\cite{mainland2010nikola}, Repa \cite{keller2010regular}, Feldspar
\cite{axelsson2010feldspar}, Obsidian, Single-assignment C (SAC) and
\textsc{Nesl} (tentative list). These languages take different
approaches to leveraging the parallel computing power of contemporary
computer architectures, and have different limitations and advantages.

The survey will consist of writing a set of realistic example programs
from the financial domain, specifically option pricing
algorithms. Example algorithms includes \textit{Longstaff and
  Schwartz}, \textit{Black-Scholes}, \textit{Binomial option pricing}
and \textit{Brownian Bridge-method for Monte Carlo simulation}.



\todo{What limitations do we already know of, and which optimisations
  do we wish to implement: Memory coalescing, distributed vs. fusion
  of maps and fold, branch divergence, }

\chapter{Learning objectives}
% What are we (as students) going to learn from performing this
% project
After completing this master thesis we will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Explain the financial applications of the pricing algorithms
%  mentioned above, and the basics of financial contracts.
\item Describe the different classes of options and how option pricing
  is performed.
\item Describe current vector languages and present relevant criteria
  for their comparison and empirical evaluation.
\item Perform empirical evaluation of vector languages according to
  the criteria developed above.
\item Write programs for GPUs and apply optimisations.
\end{itemize}
