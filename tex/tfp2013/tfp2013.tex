\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivate the interest in data-parallelism, GPUs etc.
\item Present the experiments we have performed in short
\item List of contributions
\item Overview of remaining paper
\end{itemize}

\section{Case I: Sobol-sequence generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce the simple inductive algorithm for computing
  Sobol-sequences. Note that more efficient algorithms exists, but
  we use this simple algorithm for illustrative purposes. See a more
  detailed explanation in our master's thesis.

\item Present how the algorithm would be written in a language
  allowing nesting and compare with the Accelerate version
  Write that the Nikola version is similar.
\item We should compare the generated CUDA code by Nikola and
  Accelerate and make a remark on that
\item Introduce the concept of "manual vectorisation".
\end{itemize}

\section{Case II: Binomial option pricing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Present binomial option pricing algorithm
\item Show how that would lead to host synchronization in each iteration
\item See if we can find some paper about the overhead incurred by
  extraneous kernel launches
\item Say that an alternative parallelization scheme prices several
  options simultaneously: portfolio pricing.
\item Show that we have a hard time expressing such a portfolio
  pricer, because of irregularity when performing the manual
  vectorisation
\item Present a benchmark showing the benefit of having portfolio
  pricer rather than pricing each option in their own kernels
  sequentially.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mention NESL, Data-parallel Haskell and GPU-NESL
\item Mention some of the languages we haven't tested. See if can put
  them in categories where the above problems are present and aren't,
  even though we haven't tested them as much.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extend the survey to cover additional languages and problems
\item Create a larger performance benchmark of the different languages
\item Look closer at GPU-NESL and whether it performs
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Summarize.
