\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item The free lunch is over
\item Areas where high-performance computing is found fruitful
\item Embarassingly parallel problems
\item Why the language-based approach?
\item What is a "vector language"?
\end{itemize}

\section{Report outline}
The report is structured as follows. This introductory chapter is
supplemented with two terminology introducing chapters, one on finance
and the example problems we are going to use throughout the report and
one on hardware platforms such as GPUs. The rest of the report after
these introductory chapters is divided into two independent parts. The
first part contains a survey of currently used vector languages and
their implementation techniques. The second part describes our own
efforts into \ldots

\chapter{Financial engineering}
\begin{itemize}
\item Financial pricers as a use-case with realistic example problems
\item Introduction to the financial terminology we will be using
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Hardware: GPUs, FPGAs, CUDA, OpenCL}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction to the hardware platforms we are targeting
\item History and new developments (e.g. Sandy Bridge)
\item \textit{See Martin's report on OpenCL for Accelerate}
\end{itemize}
