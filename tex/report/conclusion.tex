\section{Future Work}

\todo{Expand all these points to a section}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain how nested parallelism can be handled in newer versions
  of CUDA running on the Kepler architecture:
  \url{http://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/docs/TechBrief_Dynamic_Parallelism_in_CUDA_v2.pdf}
  Suggest using this in a new nested data-parallel language.

\item Our idea of 'sequential' should have been introduced in previous
  sections, but we should suggest implementing it more fully than we
  have had time to

\item Implementing 'sequential' as a replacement for computeS and
  computeP in Repa

\item Extending our survey to cover other languages. Specifically
  Theano, Bohrium and Copperhead.

\item Change our survey to cover portfolio pricing. Longstaff and
  Schwartz pricer on a single option is not worthwhile on GPUs, with
  our current approach. But implementing it as a portfolio pricer
  might give us benefits.

\item This community really needs a way of comparing their work, to
  make it more competitive. We should look at doing a Computer
  Languages Benchmark Game for data parallel languages, with both a
  GPU and CPU category (W. \url{http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/}

\item Cite SPL and the PJ/LexiFi paper and suggest using Longstaff and
  Schwartz for pricing their contracts.
\item Loop constructors for Nikola's \texttt{P} monad (e.g. fold, see binomial example).
\end{itemize}
