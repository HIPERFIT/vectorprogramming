\section{The Binomial Algorithm}

A relatively simple model for computing the price of an american style option
is the \emph{standard binomial model} \todo{(citation needed) (mentioned by
Rolf).}. The finance background for this model is beyond the
scope of this thesis.

Operationally, the model works by estimating the price of the option in
lattice points, connected to form a binomial tree.

\todo{Nice picture here, like the one in Rolfs FAMÃ˜S article.}

The edge between lattice nodes signifies a certain equational relationship, and
thus the value of a node at time $t$ may be calculated from the two adjacent
nodes from time $t+1$.
