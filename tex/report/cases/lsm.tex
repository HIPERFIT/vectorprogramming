\section{Longstaff \& Schwartz pricing}

Another model of american option pricing is manifest in the Least
Squares Monte Carlo algorithm LSM. Here Monte Carlo simulation is used
to generate a corpus of possible price developments of the underlying
asset, and the option price is then calculated by successively
applying linear regression at each time step from expiration to
initiation time.

\todo{Here we explain the LSM algorithm and that we're currently looking
explicitly at sobol sequences}
