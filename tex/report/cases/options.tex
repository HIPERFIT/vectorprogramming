\section{Option pricing}
Finance as a mathematical discipline is concerned with the pricing of
assets.  Financial assets can be material objects such as goods, or
contracts on other assets. The \emph{stock} issued by a company is a
common example of a financial contract. However, as this definition of
a financial asset is recursive, contracts on other contracts are
possible. An \emph{option} to buy or sell some other asset for some
price at some point in time is a common example, and the one that we
will invest some of our effort treating. These types of contracts are
commonly termed \emph{financial derivatives}.

\emph{Option} is the name used collectively for a range of different
financial contracts that all share some features, namely that an
option on an underlying asset $A$ gives the holder the right to
exchange $A$ for a certain strike price $K$ in a certain time interval
up until a prespecified expiration time $T$.

The different types of options vary the processes that determine the
size of strike price and the time span where the option may be
exercised.  We make a distinction between options that grants a right
to buy and those that grants a right to sell. A \emph{call option} on
asset $A$ grants the right to buy $A$, whereas a \emph{put option}
grants the right to sell.

For a concrete example, consider this:
\begin{example}[European Call Option]
  European options\footnote{The continent of Europe is completely unrelated to
  the naming of this contract.} are characterised by having a pre-determined
  constant strike price $K$, and may be exercised only on the expiration time
  $T$.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Assume the price of a stock $A$ is quoted as $S_0=\$90$ at time
    $t_0$, and that an European call option for the stock has a strike
    price of $K=\$100$ and expiration time $T=t_1$.

    % \item So, having acquired a European call option for 1 of IBM company stock
    %   with strike price \$100 and expiration time January 1st, we wait.
    %   \todo{What is $S_0$ in this example?}

  \item When upon the arrival of $t_1$ we observe that $A$ is now
    exchanged at value $S_1=\$105$, we choose to exercise our option right
    and thus recieve 1 stock for \$100.

    \item Immediately, we sell this stock on the market for \$105 and have thus
      earned $S_1-K=\$5$. Our option was ``in the money''.
  \end{itemize}

  Note that in reality, the underlying asset rarely changes hands. Instead,
  only the net difference in strike price and market price is
  exchanged.\footnote{A consequence of this is that you are not required to
  actually own any quantity of the underlying asset for which you issue an
  option for.}
\end{example}

The challenge of option contracts resides in how to determine their
price. The complexity of that challenge varies along with the
differences in parameters.  The value of European options for instance
is closely approximated by the Black-Scholes formula
\cite{black1973pricing}, which is a closed form analytical solution.
In contrast to European options lie American options\footnote{Which
  are similarly irrelevantly named.}, characterised by granting the
right to exercise at any point in time up until expiration, rather
than only at expiration.

This difference in granted rights makes American options require a different
pricing method than European options. But as of today, only numerical
approximation schemes are known for this type of contract. While this may be
detrimental for those that depend on accurate pricing of their financial
assets, it is all the more interesting for researchers of computing to treat.
