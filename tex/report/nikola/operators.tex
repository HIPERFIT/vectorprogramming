\section{Implemented operators}

Upon starting to code our cases in Nikola, we were immediately confronted with
the lacking of some of the operations we were used to from working with lists
in Haskell and other functional programming languages.  Especially the lack of
ability to define recursive functions contributed to highlighting their
absence.

All these extensions draw on Nikolas implementation of 'push' arrays. As mentioned earlier, the difference between delayed arrays and push arrays lie in their.........

\subsection{unfold for push arrays}

The only way Nikola presents operations for constructing arrays is with
independent elements through the delayed array constructor function
\texttt{fromFunction}.
