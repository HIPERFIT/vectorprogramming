As concluded in our survey, we have chosen to experiment with extending Nikola
in terms of expressiveness rather than performance.  To meet this end we have
implemented a small selection common functional list operations on Nikola
arrays to the extent they were possible given the constraints of nested
parallelism and nested arrays.

Afterwards we present a new language construct intended for
mitigating the compilation problem presented by nested data parallelism.

Unfortunately we have not been able to get any of these extensions completely
ready for use and possible inclusion into Nikola. We will however give an
analysis of what is lacking for a more complete implementation.
