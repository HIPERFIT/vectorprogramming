%In accordance with our learning objectives,
We have implemented a small selection common functional list operations on
Nikola arrays to the extent they were possible given the constraints of nested
parallelism and nested arrays, in order to improve on the expressiveness of the
language. Afterwards we present a new language construct intended for
mitigating the compilation problem presented by nested data parallelism.

Unfortunately we have not been able to get any of these extensions completely
ready for use and possible inclusion into Nikola. We will however give an
analysis of what is lacking for a more complete implementation.
