\chapter{Par/Seq evaluation}

\todo{Here we describe our extension idea of the 'sequential' operator, what it
would do to expressivity, and what it appears to enable for performance tuning
(i.e. deciding the degree of parallelism). Also, we describe how we implemented
it, or if we don't get to it, how it might be implemented.}
