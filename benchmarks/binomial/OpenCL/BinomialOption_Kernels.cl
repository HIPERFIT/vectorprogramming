 * For a description of the algorithm and the terms used, please see the

 *
 * Each group invocation of this kernel, calculates the option value for a

 * free interest and volatility factor.
 *
 * Multiple groups calculate the same with different input values.
 * Number of work-items in each group is same as number of leaf nodes
 * So, the maximum number of steps is limited by loca memory size available
 *
 * Each work-item calculate the leaf-node value and update local memory. 
 * These leaf nodes are further reduced to the root of the tree (time step 0).
